      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
      When I’m not immersed in coding, you’ll find me on the football field or humming my favorite tunes, I’ve always loved singing. I’ve also had the chance to work with a few NGOs, which has been such a rewarding experience. Oh, and I’m currently working on a research paper still a work in progress, but I’m really excited about it!
